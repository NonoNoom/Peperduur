Hi! For a schoolproject, my groupmembers and I created a boardgame, which is called "Peperduur". 
Now, a year later, one other groupmember and I decided to use this boardgame again for our PWS (final research project at the end of high school).
Each player has to choose in which continent they want to start. Our PWS is about what the win chances are for each continent in this boardgame.
This code is a simulation that calculates these chances.
